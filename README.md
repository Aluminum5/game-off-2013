#Git Hub Game Off 2013
##The Game

You play as a pigment that's lost its color and must absorb the power from colors in the world in order to be restored to true vibrant form. You race through a forever-scrolling obstacle course of colors, and you change between colors in order to pass safely. For example, if you are blue you can pass through blue, but you collide with all other colors. Traverse as much of the world as possible, while absorbing as much color as you can. Use absorbed colors to purchase upgrades in order to restore Pigment back to his full form.

##Tools
